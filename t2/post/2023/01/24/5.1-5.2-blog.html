<p>There are many things made by computing, but each of the products created by computing can have both positive and negative effects.</p>

<p>Example: ChatGPT</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Benefits: More streamlined version of google, easier to search for answers to your questions
Harms: Being reliant on it can lead to lack of critical thinking, created biased answers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
    <ol>
      <li>Beneficial Effect: Increased productivity and efficiency through automation of repetitive tasks. Harmful Effect: Loss of jobs due to automation of tasks that were previously performed by humans.</li>
      <li>Beneficial Effect: Improved communication and connectivity through technology. Harmful Effect: Decrease in face-to-face communication and increased feelings of isolation.</li>
      <li>Beneficial Effect: Access to vast amounts of information through the internet. Harmful Effect: Spread of misinformation and the erosion of critical thinking skills.</li>
    </ol>

  <li>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
Regarding the dopamine issues mentioned in the video, it is true that technology can have an impact on our brain chemistry. Studies have shown that the use of social media and video games can release dopamine, which is associated with pleasure and reward. However, excessive use can lead to addiction and negatively impact one’s mental and physical health. It is important to be aware of this and make conscious choices about how much time is spent on technology. It is not a parent conspiracy but a real concern that should be taken seriously. In terms of personal study and success in high school, it is important that I strike a balance between technology use and other activities such as exercise, socializing, and studying to ensure academic success.

<h1 id="52-digital-divide">
<a class="anchor" href="#52-digital-divide" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5.2: Digital Divide</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>“To Have and Have Not” in relation to Computers, Internet, or Technology in general</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Less or little access to Technology for poorer or rural areas in America and other countries</li>
    <li>Restricted access in different countries or even schools</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Factors contributing to the digital divide include socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic factors</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Individuals may not have access to the latest updates; using older generation of computers</li>
    <li>money, religion, education, location, education, nationality, ethnicity, region</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Example: Distance Learning</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>at the start of the pandemic 90,000 school children in New Jersey did not have access to computers that would allow them to learn online.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#blog-post-reflection---digital-empowerment" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog Post Reflection - Digital Empowerment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
To empower oneself in a technology-driven world, one can acquire knowledge and skills on using technology through their teachers, programs, or online resources.</li>
  <li>How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
An individual who is empowered can help others by volunteering for programs that promote technology access, advocating for policy changes to bridge the technology divide, and sharing resources and knowledge with those who lack access to technology. An example of something that can be done at Del Norte High School is volunteering to teach a technology class or starting a program to provide access to technology to students in need.</li>
  <li>Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Bureaucratic processes can be barriers to technology empowerment as they can slow down or prevent the implementation of technology in certain institutions or organizations. For example, the Del Norte is has been blocking multiple websites that can be accessed through their internet in order to promote safety when browsing, but it also makes it difficult for students to access certain applications or websites that they need when it is blocked by the school. This is not just in Del Norte but also in the various schools that surround us.</li>

<h1 id="questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit.
    <ol>
      <li>Creates a competitive environment between users</li>
      <li>Allows user to have fun playing a snake game</li>
      <li>Helps work on the users hand-eye coordination</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.
    <ul>
      <li>If someone has an extremely high score, others may be discouraged from making the leaderboard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
In my opinion, internet blockers at routers can be beneficial for limiting access to certain websites and protecting students from harmful content. However, it can also be detrimental to students’ education as it may limit their access to necessary resources for research and classwork. On the other hand, not having admin passwords on lab machines at school can provide a sense of security in terms of preventing students from installing malicious software or altering the machines in any way, but it can also prevent students from making any necessary adjustments or installing programs they need for their work.</li>
  <li>What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others.
One concern about the digital divide is that it can perpetuate social and economic inequality. Those without access to technology and the internet may be at a disadvantage in terms of education, job opportunities, and access to information. Additionally, lack of digital literacy skills can make it difficult for individuals to fully participate in the digital economy and society. Furthermore, it could also lead to a lack of representation of certain communities in the digital space. This could lead to further marginalization of already marginalized groups in society.</li>
