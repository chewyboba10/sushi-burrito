Open a terminal in vscode, run command: cd _notebooks, type &#39;wget&#39; and paste this link into said terminal and run it . | Take notes wherever you please, but you will be graded on participating . | . So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | . Big Question . Which of the following simulations could be the LEAST useful? . | A retailer trying to identify which products sold the most . | A restaurant determining the efficiency of robots | An insurance company studying the rain impact of cars | A sports bike company studying design changes to their new bike design | . If you guessed a bike company, you&#39;re wrong, because the retail simulation was the right answer. Simulating robots in food service, sudying rain impact on vehicles, and new bike design can contribute a lot more to society in comparison to seeing what products sell more than others. | . Next Big Question . If you were making a simulation for making a new train station, which of the following would be true about this simulation? . It could reveal potential problems/safety issues before construction starts | It cannot be used to test the train station in different weather | Simulation will add high costs to projects | Simulation is not needed because this train station already exists | . Potential Saftey was the right answer, because you need somewhere to test the safety and ethicness of what you&#39;re about to do before you start building it. Otherwise, let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll have a special plaque for FBI&#39;s Most Wanted | . Simulation 1: . Both programs below do the same thing. Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . It will take 1.0101525445522108 seconds for an object that weighs 2 pounds to fall 5.0 meters in a vacuum . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it.

This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomy generate steps on a 2d plane. Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | .

            "content": "Chapter 29 Assignment #1: 29.1 . FQ: What were the goals of the revolt in sexual mores, the youth protests and student revolts, the feminist movement, and the antiwar protests? To what extent were their goals achieved? . 4/4 . A Culture of Protest . Permissive Society: The Western society after World War II that experienced more sexual freedom. Sexual freedom due to the increased accessibility of the birth control pill in the 1960s, but also included more freedom in homosexuality. This freedom saw an increase in pre- or extra-marital gratification. . Feminism: Revived in the late 1960s and accompanied the student protests. The interest in feminism create the women’s liberation movement which protests for true equality with men in their lives, have equal opportunities, and others like equal pay. The growth of this movement was helped by Betty Friedan’s work The Feminine Mystique which said that women did not have equality with men and were not growing to their potentials. . NOW: Founded by Betty Friedan in 1966, also known as the National Organization of Women. Aimed to have women have full participation in society and provide them with responsibilities and privileges that were the same as men. . Betty Friedan: Important figure in the women’s liberation movement. Published The Feminine Mystique and founded NOW . Kent State Protest: An antiwar protest against the Second Vietnam was in 1970. Protests escalated after President Lysdon Johnson instituted a military draft. This protest at Kent State University resulted in the death of four student protests by the Ohio National Guard. Resulted in the decline of the antiwar movement. This decline could also be from the American willingness to continue the war and the violence creating an appeal for “law and order.” . | Various protest movements in the Western world in the late 1960s . Education, sexual mores, women’s rights . | Antiwar movement against the Second Vietnam War . | . | Goals of these movements were not achieved immediately . Helped propel forces that would transform Western society . | . | . Revolt in Sexual Mores . WWI weakened that rigid code of morals and manners of the 19th c. . New sexual freedom (police in Berlin gave cards that allowed male and female homosexual prostitutes to practice their trade), exploring drugs, introduction of pornography in the 1920s . | Mostly happened in major cities and affected a small number of people . | | Changes in manner and morals were much more significant after WWI and was called the permissive society . | Sexual revolution in the 60s started in Sweden . Sex ed in school . | Disciminalization of homosexuality . | | U.S. and Europe also experienced this revolution . Gay rights movement in California in 1969 . Affected France, Italy, and Britain in 1970 . | | | The pill became more accessible in the mid-60s . Allowed people to be more free in sexual behavior . | | Once hidden subjects became widely known like sexually explicit plays, books, and movies . Allowed public sale of pornography and open prostitution in cities, like Amsterdam . Attracted many tourists . | | | Traditional family was broken apart by the new standards . Dramatic increase in divorice rates in the 60s . | Pre- and extra- marital sex rose substantially . 86% of women and 78% of men participated in extramarital sex based on a 1968 Netherland survey . | | | Another aspect of the sexual revolution for men was the Playboy magazine tha emerged in the 50s . Encouraged men to seek participate in extramarital sex through its nude photographs and articles on masculinity . | | | Youth Protest and Student Revolt . Drugs became part of the culture among young people during the 60s . Marijuna was the main choice of recreational drugs for college and university students . | | Harvard’s psychedelic research on the effects of LSD was done by Timothy Leary and became the leader of hallucinogenic experiences . Young people interested in mind expansion to high levels of consciousness . | | Attitudes towards sex and drugs were one way the youth of the 60s rebelled and questioned authority . | The Second Vietnam War and growing political conscious produced a youth protest movement in the late 60s . | Higher education was reserved for the wealthier classes before WWI . High education became more accessible through lowering fees which increased enrollment of those from the lower and middle classes . | | Student resentment produced from the learning environment . The classrooms after WWII had too many students and professors didn’t pay attention to the students . | Authoritarian-like administrators . | Students felt that the curriculum didn’t keep up with the times . | | The student’s discontent produced revolts in the late 1960s . Also came from students against the Second Vietnam War . | Most famous student revolt was in France, 1968 . | | French student revolt led to others in Europe . None became mass movements . | | West Berlin student revolt protested against Axel Springer, who was the leader of Germany&#39;s largest newspaper establishment . Wanted to destroy what they saw as the corrupt old order . | Influenced by the ideas of Herbert Marcuse who believed that students could free society from the capitalist ruling class . | | Germans’ attempt of revolution failed due to Berliners supporting police repression . | The peak of the student protest movement was in 1968 . | Causes of student radicalism . Wanted reform in universities . | Against the Second Vietnam War . | Against the materialism of society . | | Revolts died in the 70s but the ideas they raised revived in the 90s and 2000s . | | The Feminist Movement . Interest in feminism revived in the late 60s which led to the women’s liberation movement (WLM) . Argued that they were still not being treated equally to men despite having political and legal equality . | Women still paid less than men for the same job . | Traditional views of women . | | Betty Friedan contributed to the growth of the WLM in her 1963 work The Feminine Mystique . Argued that the expectation of the “ideal housewife and mother” limited women from growing to their full potential . | said that it affects the mental and physical health of the country . | | Friedan’s work propelled her into a well-known figure . | Friedan founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966 . Goals of women having equal privileges and responsibilities with men and be treated equally in society . | Helped the call for an amendment for equal rights of women in the U.S. Constitution . | | | Antiwar Protests . Another one of the main causes of the youth protests was the Second Vietnam War . Viewed as an act of imperialism and aggression . | | Demonstrations took place in Britain, France, and Italy in 1968 . Backfired due to people who liked order over chaos . | | Paolo Pasolini, Italian poet and intellectual, viewed the youth as spoiled brats that are narrow minded . | Divided the U.S. when a military draft was enacted by President Lyndon Johnson for the war in Vietnam escalated protests . Occupation of university buildings, sit-ins, teach-ins, and demonstrations that often led to violence . | | The Kent State Protest in 1970 at Kent State University resulted in 4 students being killed by the Ohio National Guard . Caused the antiwar movement to decline . Also due to Americans becoming more willing to continue the war . | Protests also caused a support for “law and order” . | | | | | . Summary . 29.1 Interaction . “Student Revolts of 1968”: Cause and Effect Flowchart . Cause Effect . Too many students for every professor . some professors didn’t pay attention to their students . | . | Authoritarian-like administrators . | Second Vietnam War . | Students felt like curriculum didn’t match with the times . | Students disliked the materialism of society . | . | Revolts against the Second Vietnam War in US and Europe . Kent State Protest resulted in the deaths of 4 students by the Ohio National Guard . | Americans as a whole became more unwilling to continue the war . | . | Student Revolts in France . | Revolts backfired due to public disliking the chaos and wanting order again . | . | .",

Simulation Example: SimCity . . One example of a simulation in a software or game that is popular among many people is a city-building game, such as SimCity. This type of simulation allows players to design and build their own virtual cities, complete with roads, buildings, and other infrastructure. The game uses complex algorithms and data sets to simulate the various systems and processes involved in city planning and management, such as traffic flow, resource management, and population growth. As the player interacts with the simulation, they are able to see how their decisions as a city planner affect the development and growth of their virtual city. The goal of a city-building game is to provide an engaging and entertaining experience that allows players to explore their creativity and problem-solving skills in a simulated environment. .",

Inside the loop, the code prompts the user to add an assignment and asks for the assignment name and due date. | When the user enters this information, the code creates a new Assignment object and adds it to the list of assignments. | After the user indicates that they don&#39;t want to add any more assignments, the code prints out a list of all the assignments and their due dates. |",

Bits . a bit (short for binary digit) is the basic unit of information used in computing and digital communications. It is a binary digit, that is, it can have only two values:0 or 1. These two values are typically used to represent the two logical states of a system, such as &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off,&quot; &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false,&quot; or &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low.&quot; A bit is the smallest unit of information that can be processed by a computer, and it is typically used to store and manipulate data in a computer&#39;s memory or storage. . Bytes . In computer science, a byte is a unit of information that typically consists of 8 bits. It is a basic unit of measurement used to represent the amount of data in computer memory or storage. A byte is used to store a single character in a computer&#39;s memory or on disk. Bytes are often used to represent larger values or data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or text strings. . Hexadecimal . In computer science and digital technology, hexadecimal is a positional numeral system with a base of 16. It uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0-9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F to represent values ten to fifteen. Hexadecimal is commonly used in computer science to represent binary data in a more compact and readable form. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), which means that two hexadecimal digits can represent a byte (8 bits) of information. For example, the hexadecimal number 3F represents the binary number 0011 1111. . Nibbles . A nibble is a term used in computer science to refer to a group of four bits, or half of a byte. It is often used to represent a single hexadecimal digit, which can be used to represent binary data in a more compact and readable form. . Binary Numbers . In computer science and digital technology, the term &quot;binary&quot; refers to a system of representing numbers or information using only two different digits, usually 0 and 1. This system is known as the binary numeral system, and it is used by most computers and other digital devices because it is a simple and efficient way to represent and manipulate data. .

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . import random outsideTemp = random.randint(-500,500) def convertFahrenheit(Fahrenheit): celsius = Fahrenheit - 32 celsius = celsius * 5/9 # code goes here return celsius convertFahrenheit(outsideTemp) . 124.44444444444444 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . currentGrade &lt;- currentPoints / 40 currentGrade &lt;- currentGrade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; quizGrade quizGrade &lt;- currentGrade . def finalGrade(): currentPoints = input(&quot;How many points did you earn?&quot;) quizGrade = input(&quot;What was your original grade?&quot;) currentGrade = int(currentPoints) / 40 currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; int(quizGrade): quizGrade = currentGrade print(quizGrade) else: print(currentGrade) finalGrade() . 97.5 . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() . Hacks . Write a python procedure about something which can help you in school, for example the teacher’s function we spoke about earlier. | Points will be awarded based on creativity and functionality | 0.1 points will be deducted for late submissions | Submit the notes with all blanks filled in (scored out of 0.5 points) and the python procedure (scored out of 0.5 points) by Monday 12/12 at 11:59 PM. | . def procedure() # code goes here return # code goes here .",

This is because the GCD of a number and 0 is always the number itself. | The next step is the recursive step, where the function calls itself with the arguments (a % b, b) if a is greater than or equal to b, or (a, b % a) if b is greater than a. This step is based on the Euclidean algorithm, which states that the GCD of two numbers a and b is the same as the GCD of b and the remainder of a divided by b (i.e. a % b). | This recursive step continues until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns the GCD of a and b. | Binary Search Hacks . def binary_search(array, x): low = 0 high = len(array) - 1 while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low) // 2 if array[mid] == x: return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = binary_search(array, x) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Element is not present in the array&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . This implementation follows the steps outlined in the previous section: . It initializes the low and high pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively. | It uses a while loop to iterate until the low and high pointers meet each other. | In each iteration, it finds the middle element of the current subarray (defined by the low and high pointers) and compares it to the target x. | If the middle element is equal to x, it returns the index of the middle element. | If x is greater than the middle element, it updates the low pointer to be the element immediately after the middle element, so that the search will continue on the right (greater) half of the array. | If x is smaller than the middle element, it updates the high pointer to be the element immediately before the middle element, so that the search will continue on the left (lower) half of the array. | If the while loop completes without finding x, it returns -1 to indicate that x is not present in the array. |",

Example of using NumPy for derivatives: . import numpy as np # defining polynomial function var = np.poly1d([2, 0, 1]) print(&quot;Polynomial function, f(x): n&quot;, var) # calculating the derivative derivative = var.deriv() print(&quot;Derivative, f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative) # calculates the derivative of after # given value of x print(&quot;When x=5 f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative(5)) . Polynomial function, f(x): 2 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 4 x When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 20 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 . Convert the following procedure to Python, then determine the range of outputs if n = 5. . PROCEDURE Dice(n) sum ← 0 REPEAT UNTIL n = 0 sum ← sum + RANDOM(1, 6) n ← n - 1 RETURN sum . import random # Fill in the blank def Dice(n): sum = 0 while n != 0: sum = sum + random.randint(1, 6) n = n - 1 return sum # Code here Dice(5) # Will output a range of 5 to 30 . 19 . Homework . Write a procedure that generates n random numbers, then sorts those numbers into lists of even and odd numbers (JS or Python, Python will be easier). . | Using NumPy and only coding in python cell, find the answer to the following questions: a. What is the derivative of 2x^5 - 6x^2 + 24x? b. What is the derivative of (13x^4 + 4x^2) / 2 when x = 9? . | Suppose you have a group of 10 dogs and 10 cats, and you want to create a random order for them. Show how random number generation could be used to create this random order. . | .",

            "content": "Night at the Museum Reflection . Goals . The Night at the Museum was an event coordinated by the visual arts and computer science departments to create an opportunity for students to observe and learn from the projects of others while benefiting from their gains. It allowed students to gain a broader range of perspectives and views from their fellow students projects. The projects displayed by the Tri 1 APCSP classes utilized two web applications with one designated for Frontend display and one for Backend processing. The two endpoints were linked up via an API developed on the backend, which allows for communication between backend and frontend and ultimately interactive webpages. . Our Project . Our group created a minesweeper game where individual users need to log in into an account or create an account on the home page. This system is created by our backend API which stores users and their credentials and information in a 2 dimensional python dictionary. Our initial goal was to allow for our user to play the minesweeper game while allowing them to freely store their high scores so long as the website is up, based on the time it took them to complete the board. However, our timer was faulty and as a result, we did not make the leaderboard that would show incorrect data. Will need to continue to improve upon this project because while it is functional, it still has much to be improved. . Others Group Projects . Safin, Navan, Alex, Kalani - Made a motivational quotes website that allows users to like and dislike quotes and also giving them the ability to comment on each individual quote. . Alan, Ederick, Liav, Noor, Steven - Created a calendar that displays date and weather information. Allows users to input and store events on any date and incorporated city-wide weather data via an API. . Luke - Created a Quiz program that compiles random questions from a collection of geography, math and SAT prompts. His program has an about page that links to everyone’s fastpage blogs and has a good design. . Raunak, Tanay, Yuri, Sachit, Harsha - Created a clock alarm and stopwatch, I thought that is was impressive that they used a custom api to request data from a variety of time of timezones to display times. . Paaras, Samarth, AJ, Haoxuan - Developed an api that grabs some motivational quotes from the internet and allows users to vote on their favorite quotes through number counter. . Peacock Justin, James, Shruti, Joslyn - Created a Tetris game and used an astronomy api to create a table based on city names to provide location details such as longitude latitude and moon traits. . Advay, Krishiv, Shivansh, Dhruva, Prasith - Another motivational quotes generator with added motivational features for fitness and athletic goals. . Jonathan, Martin, Abdulla, Leonard - Created a program to return basketball stats of NBA teams, and used an API to get the stats for each team. Target audience seems to be people interested in the NBA, and I wonder how recent these stats are. . Lyntax Aniket, Soham, Ryan, Lucas - Used an api with a dictionary hosted on a flask server that has words and definitions so users can input it against a word. Which serves to play a hangman game. Which also eliminates letters and dynamically renders the character. . Ananya, Sreeja, Aliya, Clair - Created a Wordle game that uses a custom api and randomly generates a game. Also checks if words are valid are not and informs the user if they are incorrect or not. . Lily, Ekam, Ishi, Shreyas - Uses a custom dictionary api of different words and their definitions to allow users to find them and a word of the day that changes. Along with a feedback to adapt the user experience. . Aiden, Ahad, Dash, Sabine - Used an api that contained multiple games such as Tetris, blackjack, cookie clicker, and a pokemon game with custom to log losses wins, correct answers wrong and other game data. I am wondering if they took how they were able to compile multiple games within the timeframe we were given. It must have taken much effort and creative thinking. . Keira, Zeen, Ellie, Giannina - Made a custom customer survey along with a quiz that has three different quizzes for calculus, physics, and statistics, with solutions. Display is randomized with a backend database along with a quiz summary and a customer service api that prompts users with questions to save them. . Conclusion . It was very interesting to see what my peers have been up to and it is interesting that you combining api backend with frontend can create numerous results, the possibilities are countless. I do think that there are all things that we need to learn and improve on though. For example, if a list stores input data, if the server is shut down, then the inputted data will be lost. .",

Formatting Digital Coin example . JSON text transferred from the API in the previous cell was converted to a Python Dictionary called json. The &quot;coins&quot; in the dictionary contain a list of the most relevant data. Look at the code and comments to see how the original text is turned into something understandable. Additionally, there are error check to make sure we are starting the code with the expectation that the API was run correctly. . &quot;&quot;&quot; This cell is dependent on valid run of API above. - try and except code is making sure &quot;json&quot; was properly run above - inside second try is code that is used to process Coin API data Note. Run this cell repeatedly to format data without re-activating API &quot;&quot;&quot; try: print(&quot;JSON data is Python type: &quot; + str(type(json))) try: # Extracting Coins JSON status, if the API worked status = json.get(&#39;status&#39;) print(&quot;API status: &quot; + status) print() # Extracting Coins JSON data, data about the coins data = json.get(&#39;data&#39;) # Procedural abstraction of Print code for coins def print_coin(c): print(c[&quot;symbol&quot;], c[&quot;price&quot;]) print(&quot;Icon Url: &quot; + c[&quot;iconUrl&quot;]) print(&quot;Rank Url: &quot; + c[&quot;coinrankingUrl&quot;]) # Coins data was observed to be a list for coin in data[&#39;coins&#39;]: print_coin(coin) print() except: print(&quot;Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above?&quot;) print(json) except: print(&quot;This cell is dependent on running API call in cell above!&quot;) .

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

Quiz/Test Results Updated 11/9/22 . Quiz Results 10/13/22 . . Problems that I thought were challenging . I just found this question to be hard to read and analyze. I need to review collegeboard psuedo code. . After thinking about and review on why I got this answer wrong, I realized that the packets are given specific flags so that the device doesn’t need a specific order for the packets to be sent, rather the packets can be reassembled in any configuration due to the flags given to the packets, which tell the device on how to order the packets. . . Tri 1 Final Test 11/9/22 . Score: 45/50 . Problems I got incorrect: . Q8: Documentation for procedure with lists . I forgot that the square brackets referred to the indices of the list, which led to me debating between b and d, which I ended up choosing b. . Q19: Adding numbers in 4-bit representation . 4-bit binary sequences can only hold up to 16 different values, the decimal values can only be up to 16, and since 29 is greater than 16, you won’t be able to represent it in 4-bit binary sequences. . Q41: Value of r after sequence of assignments . I got slightly confused with the amount of data that I was given, which led me to assigning the wrong values to the variables. the value of q was 20, then q was assigned to p, so the value of p was 20. Then p was assigned to r, so the value of r was 20. . Q43: Value of x after REPEAT UNTIL block . I accidentally thought that the iteration would stop when result &gt; 5. . Q44: Value of y in x MOD y . I was unsure was MOD did. After researching a little into it, I learned that MOD stood for Modulus, which shows the remainder after number is divided by another. In this situation, it is x being divided by y and any remainder would be the value of z. . Things I had to research to gain more information . What are 4-bit binary sequences? How do you count them? | What is Boolean? | What is MOD? | .",

            "content": "Project Idea . Our team wishes to build a minesweeper game with a python backend that could consistently communicate with our frontend website while creating a new aesthetic to this classic game. This project would be split into two main portions each with it’s own challenge. The first portion would be making the game engine in python, while the latter portion would be to design and create an aesthetically pleasing and functional frontend to display the Game Status. . The Frontend . The frontend aspect of this project should preferably display a grid of the game and incorporate some aspect of user input. Preliminary testing and experimentation could be done through textbox inputs of coordinate values, while prospective functions could include individual buttons on the Grid itself to provide a GUI for the user to interact with. In both cases, the frontend should be able to communicate with the python backend through JSON data to send and receive data. . More aspects about the Frontend aspects will be added with additional planning in the future. . The Backend . Arguably the more challenging half of this project, the backend would primarily serve to be the game engine of the minesweeper game. Additionally, the backend would also control and organize the various pages and menus on the website. In this writeup, we will only be focusing on the main goals and challenges faced by the Backend team. . Using Object Oriented Programming to create individual objects for the game. Some aspects that could be represented by such objects would be the gameboard and also the individual cells and nodes present within the game board. -Doing so would simplify the algorithmic aspect of the game, as the board itself could have methods and attributes to help control the game logic. -Moreover, using an object to represent an individual cell in the board would provide greater functionalities than just using a single variable | Use Enumerated types with the python enum module to create different values for the type and status of each node. Each of these types could then be bound to a constant value which could then be printed on the screen | Use Recursion to create an algorithm to recursively detect adjacent cells that are safe (AKA not mines). This algorithm would work in the following format: Maintain a list of current cells already determined to be safe | Verify if the four adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells next to the selected cell are safe or not, if safe, store the coordinate point in the list, if not, record the cell as a “border cell”, terminate the recursive process, and run another helper function to determine the precise number of mines surrounding the cell | Re-call the function for each of the surrounding adjacent cells to identify other consecutive cells who are safe. | Return a list of the coordinates of a contiguous block of safe cells | Mark the cells to be safe and calculate number of surrounding mines for border cells. | . | Verify the Game status: Game is won if all mines are flagged | Game is lost if a mine was dug by the user | . | Return the final result back to the front end. If a safe cell was dug, send out a JSON containing an array of the coordinates of the cell and it’s safe neighbors. If a mine was dug, send a JSON containing a boolean value to signify the end of the game. | . SCRUM Team . Here is an infographic of the scrum process showing our roles as a team . .",

Console.log output . console.log() is similar to the function of print() in python. Running the command outputs the parameter to the console, so it you can see it in a Jupyter document. However, running the command in a web application does not make it visible from the browser. . console.log(&quot;Hello World&quot;) . Hello World . Variables . Variables in JavaScript are defined using the var keyword . var msg = &quot;Hello everyone&quot; console.log(msg) . Hello everyone . Functions . Functions are defined in JavaScript with the function keyword, a function name, and the arguments of the function. The code in the function needs to be contained in curly braces {}. . Since the variable msg was defined in the previous cell, it can be used as a parameter when calling the logIt function. . function logIt(output) { console.log(output) } logIt(msg) . Hello everyone . Reuse of a Function . Functions that have been previous defined in a previous cell can be called in any subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method is a process of creating a procedural abstraction . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;) logIt(&quot;Foo Bar!&quot;) logIt(2022) logIt(msg) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! Foo Bar! 2022 Hello everyone . Dynamic or Loosely Typed Language (string, number) . Javascript is a loosely typed language, so you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Creating a different table .

FQ: What were the goals of the revolt in sexual mores, the youth protests and student revolts, the feminist movement, and the antiwar protests? To what extent were their goals achieved? . 4/4 . A Culture of Protest . Permissive Society: The Western society after World War II that experienced more sexual freedom. Sexual freedom due to the increased accessibility of the birth control pill in the 1960s, but also included more freedom in homosexuality. This freedom saw an increase in pre- or extra-marital gratification. . Feminism: Revived in the late 1960s and accompanied the student protests. The interest in feminism create the women’s liberation movement which protests for true equality with men in their lives, have equal opportunities, and others like equal pay. The growth of this movement was helped by Betty Friedan’s work The Feminine Mystique which said that women did not have equality with men and were not growing to their potentials. . NOW: Founded by Betty Friedan in 1966, also known as the National Organization of Women. Aimed to have women have full participation in society and provide them with responsibilities and privileges that were the same as men. . Betty Friedan: Important figure in the women’s liberation movement. Published The Feminine Mystique and founded NOW . Kent State Protest: An antiwar protest against the Second Vietnam was in 1970. Protests escalated after President Lysdon Johnson instituted a military draft. This protest at Kent State University resulted in the death of four student protests by the Ohio National Guard. Resulted in the decline of the antiwar movement. This decline could also be from the American willingness to continue the war and the violence creating an appeal for “law and order.” . | Various protest movements in the Western world in the late 1960s .

New sexual freedom (police in Berlin gave cards that allowed male and female homosexual prostitutes to practice their trade), exploring drugs, introduction of pornography in the 1920s . | Mostly happened in major cities and affected a small number of people . | | Changes in manner and morals were much more significant after WWI and was called the permissive society . | Sexual revolution in the 60s started in Sweden . Sex ed in school . | Disciminalization of homosexuality . | | U.S. and Europe also experienced this revolution . Gay rights movement in California in 1969 .

Also came from students against the Second Vietnam War . | Most famous student revolt was in France, 1968 . | | French student revolt led to others in Europe . None became mass movements . | | West Berlin student revolt protested against Axel Springer, who was the leader of Germany&#39;s largest newspaper establishment . Wanted to destroy what they saw as the corrupt old order . | Influenced by the ideas of Herbert Marcuse who believed that students could free society from the capitalist ruling class . | | Germans’ attempt of revolution failed due to Berliners supporting police repression . | The peak of the student protest movement was in 1968 . | Causes of student radicalism .

Interest in feminism revived in the late 60s which led to the women’s liberation movement (WLM) . Argued that they were still not being treated equally to men despite having political and legal equality . | Women still paid less than men for the same job . | Traditional views of women . | | Betty Friedan contributed to the growth of the WLM in her 1963 work The Feminine Mystique . Argued that the expectation of the “ideal housewife and mother” limited women from growing to their full potential . | said that it affects the mental and physical health of the country . | | Friedan’s work propelled her into a well-known figure . | Friedan founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966 . Goals of women having equal privileges and responsibilities with men and be treated equally in society . | Helped the call for an amendment for equal rights of women in the U.S. Constitution . | | | Antiwar Protests . Another one of the main causes of the youth protests was the Second Vietnam War . Viewed as an act of imperialism and aggression . | | Demonstrations took place in Britain, France, and Italy in 1968 . Backfired due to people who liked order over chaos . | | Paolo Pasolini, Italian poet and intellectual, viewed the youth as spoiled brats that are narrow minded . | Divided the U.S. when a military draft was enacted by President Lyndon Johnson for the war in Vietnam escalated protests . Occupation of university buildings, sit-ins, teach-ins, and demonstrations that often led to violence . | | The Kent State Protest in 1970 at Kent State University resulted in 4 students being killed by the Ohio National Guard . Caused the antiwar movement to decline . Also due to Americans becoming more willing to continue the war . | Protests also caused a support for “law and order” . | | | | | .

This Note is mainly used to help center the objects I add | I could change the color of the objects color, or the color of texts using setting the rgba values | I can duplicate the screen if I want to keep the format of the screen I created | I saw that the user can input text and that they can choose from a dropdown menu | I can switch between block code and text code | .

Create a math themed quiz that tests users on their math knowledge | Create different difficulties | Find a way to go to a quiz of matching difficulty using the dropdown menu | Users will be able to input their answers and the computer will be able to sort out if the answer is correct | Be able to show the final score at the end of the quiz by abstracting the number of correct answers | create a variable that defines the number of questions and number of answers | . | . Process . I ended up designing a total of 13 different screens with three pairs of 3 questions, each with a different corresponding difficulty, a starting screen: Start_Window, a correct answer screen: CorrectScreen, a incorrect answer screen: WrongAnswer, and a end screen: End_Screen . . I created 3 different difficulties corresponding to different school levels . . I initially had problems figuring out how to use the dropdown to manage which difficulty quiz I would go to. However, after exploring a bit more in the code blocks, I was able to create an if else statement that would take me to different screens depending on what was chosen from the dropdown option. . . The format for all the questions is a user inputted response based one. The algorithm that I wrote makes it so that after you click the button the reads “Check Answer”, if the inputted texts matches the answer, you go to the CorrectScreen screen. If you get it wrong, you’ll go to the WrongAnswer screen (The question shown below, Normal_Question_1, is the only one where there were two possible answers, which I was able to do using double vertical bars). . . For the final question of each difficulty, I created a string concatenation that would show the results of the quiz in the blank text box in the End_Screen. . . Results and Findings (Testing) . The block form of code made it really easy to visualize how each block of code worked and made it easier to find out what went wrong. It was also cool to be able to convert the blocks into JavaScript, which made JavaScript muc easier to understand. While thinking back to how I made this quiz, I realize there are a few bugs that need to be patched up such as: . If I go back to the Start_Window clicking a “Quit” or “Home” button, the dropdown menu defaults to the previously chosen item. So if I end up choose the “Choose Difficulty” item and press start, it goes to the “Hard” difficulty. | edit: I was able to fix this by assigning a value to the variable: correct = 0 | . | The var correct does not reset back to 0 after starting another quiz | .",

Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Evan&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Aparri&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;November 10, 2005&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;evanaparri@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: &quot;none&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;sleeping&quot;] }) print(InfoDb) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: &quot;4Runner&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;eating&quot;] }) print() print() # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Hobbies: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Evan Aparri Residence: San Diego Birth Day: November 10, 2005 Cars: none Hobbies: sleeping Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner Hobbies: eating . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Evan Aparri Residence: San Diego Birth Day: November 10, 2005 Cars: none Hobbies: sleeping Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner Hobbies: eating . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Evan Aparri Residence: San Diego Birth Day: November 10, 2005 Cars: none Hobbies: sleeping Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner Hobbies: eating . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .
