            "content": "Chapter 29 Assignment #1: 29.1 . FQ: What were the goals of the revolt in sexual mores, the youth protests and student revolts, the feminist movement, and the antiwar protests? To what extent were their goals achieved? . 4/4 . A Culture of Protest . Permissive Society: The Western society after World War II that experienced more sexual freedom. Sexual freedom due to the increased accessibility of the birth control pill in the 1960s, but also included more freedom in homosexuality. This freedom saw an increase in pre- or extra-marital gratification. . Feminism: Revived in the late 1960s and accompanied the student protests. The interest in feminism create the women’s liberation movement which protests for true equality with men in their lives, have equal opportunities, and others like equal pay. The growth of this movement was helped by Betty Friedan’s work The Feminine Mystique which said that women did not have equality with men and were not growing to their potentials. . NOW: Founded by Betty Friedan in 1966, also known as the National Organization of Women. Aimed to have women have full participation in society and provide them with responsibilities and privileges that were the same as men. . Betty Friedan: Important figure in the women’s liberation movement. Published The Feminine Mystique and founded NOW . Kent State Protest: An antiwar protest against the Second Vietnam was in 1970. Protests escalated after President Lysdon Johnson instituted a military draft. This protest at Kent State University resulted in the death of four student protests by the Ohio National Guard. Resulted in the decline of the antiwar movement. This decline could also be from the American willingness to continue the war and the violence creating an appeal for “law and order.” . | Various protest movements in the Western world in the late 1960s . Education, sexual mores, women’s rights . | Antiwar movement against the Second Vietnam War . | . | Goals of these movements were not achieved immediately . Helped propel forces that would transform Western society . | . | . Revolt in Sexual Mores . WWI weakened that rigid code of morals and manners of the 19th c. . New sexual freedom (police in Berlin gave cards that allowed male and female homosexual prostitutes to practice their trade), exploring drugs, introduction of pornography in the 1920s . | Mostly happened in major cities and affected a small number of people . | | Changes in manner and morals were much more significant after WWI and was called the permissive society . | Sexual revolution in the 60s started in Sweden . Sex ed in school . | Disciminalization of homosexuality . | | U.S. and Europe also experienced this revolution . Gay rights movement in California in 1969 . Affected France, Italy, and Britain in 1970 . | | | The pill became more accessible in the mid-60s . Allowed people to be more free in sexual behavior . | | Once hidden subjects became widely known like sexually explicit plays, books, and movies . Allowed public sale of pornography and open prostitution in cities, like Amsterdam . Attracted many tourists . | | | Traditional family was broken apart by the new standards . Dramatic increase in divorice rates in the 60s . | Pre- and extra- marital sex rose substantially . 86% of women and 78% of men participated in extramarital sex based on a 1968 Netherland survey . | | | Another aspect of the sexual revolution for men was the Playboy magazine tha emerged in the 50s . Encouraged men to seek participate in extramarital sex through its nude photographs and articles on masculinity . | | | Youth Protest and Student Revolt . Drugs became part of the culture among young people during the 60s . Marijuna was the main choice of recreational drugs for college and university students . | | Harvard’s psychedelic research on the effects of LSD was done by Timothy Leary and became the leader of hallucinogenic experiences . Young people interested in mind expansion to high levels of consciousness . | | Attitudes towards sex and drugs were one way the youth of the 60s rebelled and questioned authority . | The Second Vietnam War and growing political conscious produced a youth protest movement in the late 60s . | Higher education was reserved for the wealthier classes before WWI . High education became more accessible through lowering fees which increased enrollment of those from the lower and middle classes . | | Student resentment produced from the learning environment . The classrooms after WWII had too many students and professors didn’t pay attention to the students . | Authoritarian-like administrators . | Students felt that the curriculum didn’t keep up with the times . | | The student’s discontent produced revolts in the late 1960s . Also came from students against the Second Vietnam War . | Most famous student revolt was in France, 1968 . | | French student revolt led to others in Europe . None became mass movements . | | West Berlin student revolt protested against Axel Springer, who was the leader of Germany&#39;s largest newspaper establishment . Wanted to destroy what they saw as the corrupt old order . | Influenced by the ideas of Herbert Marcuse who believed that students could free society from the capitalist ruling class . | | Germans’ attempt of revolution failed due to Berliners supporting police repression . | The peak of the student protest movement was in 1968 . | Causes of student radicalism . Wanted reform in universities . | Against the Second Vietnam War . | Against the materialism of society . | | Revolts died in the 70s but the ideas they raised revived in the 90s and 2000s . | | The Feminist Movement . Interest in feminism revived in the late 60s which led to the women’s liberation movement (WLM) . Argued that they were still not being treated equally to men despite having political and legal equality . | Women still paid less than men for the same job . | Traditional views of women . | | Betty Friedan contributed to the growth of the WLM in her 1963 work The Feminine Mystique . Argued that the expectation of the “ideal housewife and mother” limited women from growing to their full potential . | said that it affects the mental and physical health of the country . | | Friedan’s work propelled her into a well-known figure . | Friedan founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966 . Goals of women having equal privileges and responsibilities with men and be treated equally in society . | Helped the call for an amendment for equal rights of women in the U.S. Constitution . | | | Antiwar Protests . Another one of the main causes of the youth protests was the Second Vietnam War . Viewed as an act of imperialism and aggression . | | Demonstrations took place in Britain, France, and Italy in 1968 . Backfired due to people who liked order over chaos . | | Paolo Pasolini, Italian poet and intellectual, viewed the youth as spoiled brats that are narrow minded . | Divided the U.S. when a military draft was enacted by President Lyndon Johnson for the war in Vietnam escalated protests . Occupation of university buildings, sit-ins, teach-ins, and demonstrations that often led to violence . | | The Kent State Protest in 1970 at Kent State University resulted in 4 students being killed by the Ohio National Guard . Caused the antiwar movement to decline . Also due to Americans becoming more willing to continue the war . | Protests also caused a support for “law and order” . | | | | | . Summary . 29.1 Interaction . “Student Revolts of 1968”: Cause and Effect Flowchart . Cause Effect . Too many students for every professor . some professors didn’t pay attention to their students . | . | Authoritarian-like administrators . | Second Vietnam War . | Students felt like curriculum didn’t match with the times . | Students disliked the materialism of society . | . | Revolts against the Second Vietnam War in US and Europe . Kent State Protest resulted in the deaths of 4 students by the Ohio National Guard . | Americans as a whole became more unwilling to continue the war . | . | Student Revolts in France . | Revolts backfired due to public disliking the chaos and wanting order again . | . | .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
