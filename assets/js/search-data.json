            "content": "Chapter 29 Assignment #1: 29.1 . FQ: What were the goals of the revolt in sexual mores, the youth protests and student revolts, the feminist movement, and the antiwar protests? To what extent were their goals achieved? . 4/4 . A Culture of Protest . Permissive Society: The Western society after World War II that experienced more sexual freedom. Sexual freedom due to the increased accessibility of the birth control pill in the 1960s, but also included more freedom in homosexuality. This freedom saw an increase in pre- or extra-marital gratification. . Feminism: Revived in the late 1960s and accompanied the student protests. The interest in feminism create the women’s liberation movement which protests for true equality with men in their lives, have equal opportunities, and others like equal pay. The growth of this movement was helped by Betty Friedan’s work The Feminine Mystique which said that women did not have equality with men and were not growing to their potentials. . NOW: Founded by Betty Friedan in 1966, also known as the National Organization of Women. Aimed to have women have full participation in society and provide them with responsibilities and privileges that were the same as men. . Betty Friedan: Important figure in the women’s liberation movement. Published The Feminine Mystique and founded NOW . Kent State Protest: An antiwar protest against the Second Vietnam was in 1970. Protests escalated after President Lysdon Johnson instituted a military draft. This protest at Kent State University resulted in the death of four student protests by the Ohio National Guard. Resulted in the decline of the antiwar movement. This decline could also be from the American willingness to continue the war and the violence creating an appeal for “law and order.” . | Various protest movements in the Western world in the late 1960s .

Young people interested in mind expansion to high levels of consciousness . | | Attitudes towards sex and drugs were one way the youth of the 60s rebelled and questioned authority . | The Second Vietnam War and growing political conscious produced a youth protest movement in the late 60s . | Higher education was reserved for the wealthier classes before WWI .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | .
