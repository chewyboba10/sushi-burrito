            "content": "Chapter 29 Assignment #1: 29.1 . FQ: What were the goals of the revolt in sexual mores, the youth protests and student revolts, the feminist movement, and the antiwar protests? To what extent were their goals achieved? . 4/4 . A Culture of Protest . Permissive Society: The Western society after World War II that experienced more sexual freedom. Sexual freedom due to the increased accessibility of the birth control pill in the 1960s, but also included more freedom in homosexuality. This freedom saw an increase in pre- or extra-marital gratification. . Feminism: Revived in the late 1960s and accompanied the student protests. The interest in feminism create the women’s liberation movement which protests for true equality with men in their lives, have equal opportunities, and others like equal pay. The growth of this movement was helped by Betty Friedan’s work The Feminine Mystique which said that women did not have equality with men and were not growing to their potentials. . NOW: Founded by Betty Friedan in 1966, also known as the National Organization of Women. Aimed to have women have full participation in society and provide them with responsibilities and privileges that were the same as men. . Betty Friedan: Important figure in the women’s liberation movement. Published The Feminine Mystique and founded NOW . Kent State Protest: An antiwar protest against the Second Vietnam was in 1970. Protests escalated after President Lysdon Johnson instituted a military draft. This protest at Kent State University resulted in the death of four student protests by the Ohio National Guard. Resulted in the decline of the antiwar movement. This decline could also be from the American willingness to continue the war and the violence creating an appeal for “law and order.” . | Various protest movements in the Western world in the late 1960s .

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

Working in a team with diverse perspectives in the development of computing innovations helps practice interpersonal skills and produces a computing innovation reflecting the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it. . Pair Programming: Two programmers work together as a pair. One writes the program code while the other reviews each line of program code . Think-Pair-Share: Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class . 1.2: Program Function and Purpose . The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression. . An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation; . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms. such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. . An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program. . Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution. . Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program. . In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through teh sequential flow of control. . Input can come from a user or other programs. . Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. . Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state. . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software. . A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. . A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations . The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacted with it . A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in detail by both what the program does and how the programs statements accomplish this function . 1.3: Program Design and Development . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature . There are multiple development processes. Commonly used phrases when developing a program: . investigating and reflecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of hte process. . A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and make sure each piece works before adding it to the whole . The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. . Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program. .

            "content": "Project Idea . Our team wishes to build a minesweeper game with a python backend that could consistently communicate with our frontend website while creating a new aesthetic to this classic game. This project would be split into two main portions each with it’s own challenge. The first portion would be making the game engine in python, while the latter portion would be to design and create an aesthetically pleasing and functional frontend to display the Game Status. . The Frontend . The frontend aspect of this project should preferably display a grid of the game and incorporate some aspect of user input. Preliminary testing and experimentation could be done through textbox inputs of coordinate values, while prospective functions could include individual buttons on the Grid itself to provide a GUI for the user to interact with. In both cases, the frontend should be able to communicate with the python backend through JSON data to send and receive data. . More aspects about the Frontend aspects will be added with additional planning in the future. . The Backend . Arguably the more challenging half of this project, the backend would primarily serve to be the game engine of the minesweeper game. Additionally, the backend would also control and organize the various pages and menus on the website. In this writeup, we will only be focusing on the main goals and challenges faced by the Backend team. . Using Object Oriented Programming to create individual objects for the game. Some aspects that could be represented by such objects would be the gameboard and also the individual cells and nodes present within the game board. -Doing so would simplify the algorithmic aspect of the game, as the board itself could have methods and attributes to help control the game logic. -Moreover, using an object to represent an individual cell in the board would provide greater functionalities than just using a single variable | Use Enumerated types with the python enum module to create different values for the type and status of each node. Each of these types could then be bound to a constant value which could then be printed on the screen | Use Recursion to create an algorithm to recursively detect adjacent cells that are safe (AKA not mines). This algorithm would work in the following format: Maintain a list of current cells already determined to be safe | Verify if the four adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells next to the selected cell are safe or not, if safe, store the coordinate point in the list, if not, record the cell as a “border cell”, terminate the recursive process, and run another helper function to determine the precise number of mines surrounding the cell | Re-call the function for each of the surrounding adjacent cells to identify other consecutive cells who are safe. | Return a list of the coordinates of a contiguous block of safe cells | Mark the cells to be safe and calculate number of surrounding mines for border cells. | . | Verify the Game status: Game is won if all mines are flagged | Game is lost if a mine was dug by the user | . | Return the final result back to the front end. If a safe cell was dug, send out a JSON containing an array of the coordinates of the cell and it’s safe neighbors. If a mine was dug, send a JSON containing a boolean value to signify the end of the game. | . SCRUM Team . Here is an infographic of the scrum process showing our roles as a team . .",

FQ: What were the goals of the revolt in sexual mores, the youth protests and student revolts, the feminist movement, and the antiwar protests? To what extent were their goals achieved? . 4/4 . A Culture of Protest . Permissive Society: The Western society after World War II that experienced more sexual freedom. Sexual freedom due to the increased accessibility of the birth control pill in the 1960s, but also included more freedom in homosexuality. This freedom saw an increase in pre- or extra-marital gratification. . Feminism: Revived in the late 1960s and accompanied the student protests. The interest in feminism create the women’s liberation movement which protests for true equality with men in their lives, have equal opportunities, and others like equal pay. The growth of this movement was helped by Betty Friedan’s work The Feminine Mystique which said that women did not have equality with men and were not growing to their potentials. . NOW: Founded by Betty Friedan in 1966, also known as the National Organization of Women. Aimed to have women have full participation in society and provide them with responsibilities and privileges that were the same as men. . Betty Friedan: Important figure in the women’s liberation movement. Published The Feminine Mystique and founded NOW . Kent State Protest: An antiwar protest against the Second Vietnam was in 1970. Protests escalated after President Lysdon Johnson instituted a military draft. This protest at Kent State University resulted in the death of four student protests by the Ohio National Guard. Resulted in the decline of the antiwar movement. This decline could also be from the American willingness to continue the war and the violence creating an appeal for “law and order.” . | Various protest movements in the Western world in the late 1960s .

Dramatic increase in divorice rates in the 60s . | Pre- and extra- marital sex rose substantially . 86% of women and 78% of men participated in extramarital sex based on a 1968 Netherland survey . | | | Another aspect of the sexual revolution for men was the Playboy magazine tha emerged in the 50s . Encouraged men to seek participate in extramarital sex through its nude photographs and articles on masculinity . | | | Youth Protest and Student Revolt . Drugs became part of the culture among young people during the 60s . Marijuna was the main choice of recreational drugs for college and university students . | | Harvard’s psychedelic research on the effects of LSD was done by Timothy Leary and became the leader of hallucinogenic experiences . Young people interested in mind expansion to high levels of consciousness . | | Attitudes towards sex and drugs were one way the youth of the 60s rebelled and questioned authority . | The Second Vietnam War and growing political conscious produced a youth protest movement in the late 60s . | Higher education was reserved for the wealthier classes before WWI . High education became more accessible through lowering fees which increased enrollment of those from the lower and middle classes . | | Student resentment produced from the learning environment . The classrooms after WWII had too many students and professors didn’t pay attention to the students . | Authoritarian-like administrators . | Students felt that the curriculum didn’t keep up with the times . | | The student’s discontent produced revolts in the late 1960s . Also came from students against the Second Vietnam War . | Most famous student revolt was in France, 1968 . | | French student revolt led to others in Europe . None became mass movements . | | West Berlin student revolt protested against Axel Springer, who was the leader of Germany&#39;s largest newspaper establishment . Wanted to destroy what they saw as the corrupt old order . | Influenced by the ideas of Herbert Marcuse who believed that students could free society from the capitalist ruling class . | | Germans’ attempt of revolution failed due to Berliners supporting police repression . | The peak of the student protest movement was in 1968 . | Causes of student radicalism . Wanted reform in universities . | Against the Second Vietnam War . | Against the materialism of society . | | Revolts died in the 70s but the ideas they raised revived in the 90s and 2000s . | | The Feminist Movement . Interest in feminism revived in the late 60s which led to the women’s liberation movement (WLM) . Argued that they were still not being treated equally to men despite having political and legal equality . | Women still paid less than men for the same job . | Traditional views of women . | | Betty Friedan contributed to the growth of the WLM in her 1963 work The Feminine Mystique .

Process . I ended up designing a total of 13 different screens with three pairs of 3 questions, each with a different corresponding difficulty, a starting screen: Start_Window, a correct answer screen: CorrectScreen, a incorrect answer screen: WrongAnswer, and a end screen: End_Screen . . I created 3 different difficulties corresponding to different school levels . . I initially had problems figuring out how to use the dropdown to manage which difficulty quiz I would go to. However, after exploring a bit more in the code blocks, I was able to create an if else statement that would take me to different screens depending on what was chosen from the dropdown option. . . The format for all the questions is a user inputted response based one. The algorithm that I wrote makes it so that after you click the button the reads “Check Answer”, if the inputted texts matches the answer, you go to the CorrectScreen screen. If you get it wrong, you’ll go to the WrongAnswer screen (The question shown below, Normal_Question_1, is the only one where there were two possible answers, which I was able to do using double vertical bars). . . For the final question of each difficulty, I created a string concatenation that would show the results of the quiz in the blank text box in the End_Screen. . . Results and Findings (Testing) . The block form of code made it really easy to visualize how each block of code worked and made it easier to find out what went wrong. It was also cool to be able to convert the blocks into JavaScript, which made JavaScript muc easier to understand. While thinking back to how I made this quiz, I realize there are a few bugs that need to be patched up such as: . If I go back to the Start_Window clicking a “Quit” or “Home” button, the dropdown menu defaults to the previously chosen item. So if I end up choose the “Choose Difficulty” item and press start, it goes to the “Hard” difficulty. | edit: I was able to fix this by assigning a value to the variable: correct = 0 | . | The var correct does not reset back to 0 after starting another quiz | .",

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Hobbies: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Evan Aparri Residence: San Diego Birth Day: November 10, 2005 Cars: none Hobbies: sleeping Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner Hobbies: eating . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set?

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .
