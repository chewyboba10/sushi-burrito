<p>The theme of the Blog could be changed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file in the home directory of the blog. Either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">theme</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remote_theme</code> key pair value can be altered. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remote_theme</code> method needs to have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-remote-theme</code> to be defined in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plugins</code> key. I decided to change to the midnight theme because I thought the theme name sounded cool.</p>

<p>I ran into a minor problem of naming the remote theme wrong, but that was quickly fixed</p>

<p>Here is what the homepage looked like:</p>

<p>The problems that I noticed were that the changes removed the blogâ€™s navigation bar such as the search and tabs. That is the main problem I saw. When opening some of my posts, they were no negatively affected, but you are unable to open the homepage once you have left:</p>

<p>One last thing that I noticed before I changed back to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minima</code> theme is that the icon of the blog does not show up. The conclusion that I came from this experiment is that other Jekyll themes are not entirely compatible with fastpages and that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minima</code> is the preferred theme.</p>
