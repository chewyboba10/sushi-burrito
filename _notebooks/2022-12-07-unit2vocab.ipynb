    "## Bits\n",
    ">a bit (short for binary digit) is the basic unit of information used in computing and digital communications. It is a binary digit, that is, it can have only two values: 0 or 1. These two values are typically used to represent the two logical states of a system, such as \"on\" or \"off,\" \"true\" or \"false,\" or \"high\" or \"low.\" A bit is the smallest unit of information that can be processed by a computer, and it is typically used to store and manipulate data in a computer's memory or storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bytes\n",
    ">In computer science, a byte is a unit of information that typically consists of 8 bits. It is a basic unit of measurement used to represent the amount of data in computer memory or storage. A byte is used to store a single character in a computer's memory or on disk. Bytes are often used to represent larger values or data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or text strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hexadecimal\n",
    ">In computer science and digital technology, hexadecimal is a positional numeral system with a base of 16. It uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0-9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F to represent values ten to fifteen. Hexadecimal is commonly used in computer science to represent binary data in a more compact and readable form. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), which means that two hexadecimal digits can represent a byte (8 bits) of information. For example, the hexadecimal number 3F represents the binary number 0011 1111.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nibbles\n",
    ">A nibble is a term used in computer science to refer to a group of four bits, or half of a byte. It is often used to represent a single hexadecimal digit, which can be used to represent binary data in a more compact and readable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Numbers\n",
    ">In computer science and digital technology, the term \"binary\" refers to a system of representing numbers or information using only two different digits, usually 0 and 1. This system is known as the binary numeral system, and it is used by most computers and other digital devices because it is a simple and efficient way to represent and manipulate data.\n",
