    "1. How can logic gates be used to execute basic computer functions? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic gates are essential components for building digital circuits and are crucial for basic computer operations. They utilize Boolean logic operations to process binary data, which enables complex decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between boolean operations and logic gates? \n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean operations and logic gates are separate components, where the former is performed by the latter. Logic gates contain different types of Boolean operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, and use Boolean data to perform various functions.\n",

    "**Question**: How do you think we should find the difference of two binary numbers? The product? The quotient? What rules need to be followed for those operations? Look into all of this on the Internet and note down important information you find (0.45) \n",
    "\n",
    "- The process for subtracting binary numbers is similar to subtracting base 10 numbers. When 1 is subtracted from 0, it's necessary to borrow 1 from the next higher bit, reducing that bit by 1, and leaving a remainder of 1.\n",
    "- When multiplying binary numbers, the product can either be the binary number itself or 0. To calculate, shift the non-zero multiplier to the left and add the shifted numbers together.\n",
    "- Dividing two binary numbers follows certain rules, and it is impossible to divide by 0. If the divisor is greater than the dividend, set the quotient to 0 and bring down the second bit of the dividend. However, if the dividend is larger, multiply the divisor by 1 and subtract the result. Then, find the remainder, repeat the first step, and continue until the remainder is 0.\n",
