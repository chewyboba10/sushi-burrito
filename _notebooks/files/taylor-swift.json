never speak\nI don't feel welcome anymore\nBaby, what happened, please tell me?\n'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door\n\nAnd I stare at the phone,\nHe still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said forever and always\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\n\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest?\nMade you run and hide\nLike a scared little boy?\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure\n\nSo here's to everything\nComing down to nothing\nHere's to silence\nThat cuts me to the core\nWhere is this
