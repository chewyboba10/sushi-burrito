## Question: 9

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q9mcq.png)

I understood the part about breaking the file into packets for transmission, but my initial assumption was that the browser would need to request each individual packet to receive it. However, I now realize that the packets are simply reassembled upon receipt.

## Question: 20

At first, I comprehended that statement II was accurate because it was evident that the data could calculate the number of phone calls made between 10:30 am and noon. However, upon further examination, I realized that statement II is also correct because the metadata divides phone numbers into two parties of a call. So, if we obtain one phone number, the metadata will retrieve all the numbers associated with that individual.

## Question: 43
