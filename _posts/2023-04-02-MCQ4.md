# Mistakes

## Question: 9

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q9mcq.png)

- I got the part where the file is broke into packets for transmission, but I originally thought that the browser would have to request each packet to recieve it, but really the packets are just reassembled upon reciept.

## Question: 20

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q20mcq.png)

- I understood that II is correct because it is clear that the data could estimate the numebr of phone calls between 10:30 am and noon, but really statement II is also correct because the metadata stores the phone numbers into two parties of a call. Therefore if we get one phone number, the metadata will process all numbers assigned to that person.

## Question: 43

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q43mcq.png)

- This was just a really silly mistake, the whole point of procedural extraction is to reduce the amount of the same code with different numbers or variables, I probably just sped through this problem.
