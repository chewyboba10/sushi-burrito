# Lists
> a sequence of variables
- can be used to store multiple items into one variable
- used to store collections of data
- changeable, ordered, allowed duplicates

## Other collection data types in Python
- Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates
- Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn't allow duplicate
- Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn't allow duplicates

## Terms
- Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to element in a list (allows for duplicates)
- Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index

# Iteration
> The repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement
Types of iteration: definite and indefinite
- Definite defines how many times the loop is going to run
- Indefinite specifies a condition that must be met
