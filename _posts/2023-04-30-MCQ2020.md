## Correction
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq2020.png)
A is the right answer due to the explanation shown in the photo. B is incorrect because 224 would have a binary value of 11100000 (2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 = 128 + 64 + 32 = 224)

## Reflection
Their way of translating binary to decimal is useful to remember. any "1" value in the binary number means take 2 to the power of whatever digit place it is and add it to any other "1" value.
