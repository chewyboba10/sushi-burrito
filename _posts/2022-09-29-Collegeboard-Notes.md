# Big Idea 1
Creative Development
> AP Exam Weighting 10-13%

## 1.1: Collaboration

Working in a team with diverse perspectives in the development of computing innovations helps practice interpersonal skills and produces a computing innovation reflecting the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.

Pair Programming: Two programmers work together as a pair. One writes the program code while the other reviews each line of program code

Think-Pair-Share: Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class

## 1.2: Program Function and Purpose

The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.

An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation;

Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms. such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.

An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.

Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.

Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program.

In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through teh sequential flow of control.

Input can come from a user or other programs.

Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device.

Program output is usually based on a program's input or prior state.

A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software.

A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.

A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations

The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacted with it

A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in detail by both what the program does and how the programs statements accomplish this function

## 1.3: Program Design and Development

A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature

There are multiple development processes. Commonly used phrases when developing a program:
- investigating and reflecting
- designing
- prototyping
- testing

A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of hte process.

A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and make sure each piece works before adding it to the whole

The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.

Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
