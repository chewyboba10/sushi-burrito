# College Board Create Performance Task

## Plan and ideas

- Organizing various recipes based on where it originates, the ingredients it uses, and how long the recipe takes
- Organizing various animals based on where it lives, what it eats, it population size, etc.
- More ideas coming soon

### Row 1: Program Purpose and Function
>Know the difference between program **purpose** and **function**

The purpose of my program will be to find specific recipes with conditions the user sets while the function will that users can specify what things they are looking for in a recipe (nationality, ingredients, time) that will be sorted by the computer.

### Row 2: Data Abstraction
>Assesses students' ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program (Skill Abstraction in Program Development - data)

Create lists and dictionaries that show what the nationality of the recipe, the ingredients that it uses, and how long it takes.

### Row 3: Managing Complexity
>Explain how abstraction manages complexity (Skill Abstraction in Program Development explain complexity)

Similar to how my posts are tagged, I want to create different tags for the recipes I put in the program so that it can be sorted out that way. Make different functions to reduce the complexity and therefore compartmentalizing the code.

### Row 4: Procedural Abstraction
>Use abstraction to manage complexity in a program (Skill Abstraction in Program Development - procedures/functions)

Find a way to sort it out the recipes based on input the user provides.

### Row 5: Algorithm Implementation
>Implement and apply an algorithm (Skill Algorithms and Program Development)

Still need to learn how to make good algorithms that are more efficient and are more complex

### Row 6: Testing
>Investigate the situation, context, or task (Skill Computational Solution Design - testing)

Test that the recipes sort out in the different ways I want them to. Ask for others' opinions during the tests

## Different Ways to study

- Khan Academy
- Look at notes/old code
- research on the internet
