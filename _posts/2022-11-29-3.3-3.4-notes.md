# Mathematical Expressions and Strings

## Algorithms
> A set of instructions that can accomplish a specific task

Three components of an algorithm
1. *Sequencing*: Algorithms do task in the order of specification
2. *Selection*: Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision
3. *Iteration*: If a condition is true, then the code can repeat

Two different ways algorithms can be represented
1. *Flowcharts*: The steps of an algorithm are represented by shapes and arrows
2. *Pseudocode*: A blend of human language and coding format

## Arithmetic Operations

**Basic Operations**

Addition is represented by `+`
    Example: `num1 = 2 + 1` which would make `num1 = 3`

Subtraction is represented by `-`
    Example: `num1 = 2 - 1` which would make `num1 = 1`

Multiplication is represented by `*`
    Example: `num1 = 2 * 1` which would make `num1 = 2`

Division is represented by `/`
    Example: `num1 = 2 / 1` which would make `num1 = 2`

Remainder is represented by MOD in psuedo code (% in python)
    Example: `num1 = 5 % 2` which would make `num1 = 1`

Order of operations applies

## Variables
- Numerical value stored in a variable
- Value of another variable stored in a variable
- Result of an operation stored in a variable
- Result of a procedure call stored in a variable

Sequence of variables is important

## String
> A collection of characters. Characters can be anything from numbers, letters, spaces, etc.

Certain procedures can be used to affect string
Examples:
    `len()` to find the length of string
    `concat()` returns the strings as a concatenation of multiple strings
    `lower()` to convert to lowercase
