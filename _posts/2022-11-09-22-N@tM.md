# Night at the Museum Reflection

## Goals
The Night at the Museum was an event coordinated by the visual arts and computer science departments to create an opportunity for students to observe and learn from the projects of others while benefiting from their gains. The projects displayed by the Tri 1 APCSP classes utilized two web applications with one designated for Frontend display and one for Backend processing. The two endpoints were linked up via an API developed on the backend, which allows for communication between backend and frontend and ultimately interactive webpages.

## Our Project
Our group created a minesweeper game where individual users need to log in into an account or create an account on the home page. This system is created by our backend API which stores users and their credentials and information in a 2 dimensional python dictionary. Our initial goal was to allow for our user to play the minesweeper game while allowing them to freely store their high scores so long as the website is up, based on the time it took them to complete the board. However, our timer was faulty and as a result, we did not make the leaderboard that would show incorrect data. Will need to continue to improve upon this project because while it is functional, it still has much to be improved.
