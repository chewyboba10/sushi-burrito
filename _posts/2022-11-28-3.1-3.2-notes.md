# Variables
> An abstraction inside a program that can hold a value


- Variables should be something simple; not very complicated and not to vague
- Use meaningful variables to help the program be easier to read
Three parts of a variable:
- name
- value
- type

Types of data
- integer (number)
- Text/string: word
Boolean: Data that determines if something is true or false

lists can be stored as variables
> specific values in the list can be retrieved from the list without creating multiple variables and data can be easily changed

# Assignments
> assigns values to variables

Allows the program to change the value represented by a variable


# Data Abstraction
- represents data in a useful form, takes away aspects of data that are unused in the situation
- variables and lists and main tools for data abstraction
- separates abstract properties of data type and concrete details of its representations

## Lists in Data Abstractions

- Multiple elements can be stored together and treated as a single value in a list
- Data abstraction is possible
- Elements can be added
