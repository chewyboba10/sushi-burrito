# Plans
As stated at the beginning of the Trimester 3, I plan to distinguish my code from the rest of my group and others so that it does not looked copied and so it can also reflect what I have learned.

I plan to incorporate the lessons we have learned in the past few weeks like the the spacetime complexity, extracting data, image compression, etc. where possible. I am also planning on adding a working update and delete in my frontend code.
