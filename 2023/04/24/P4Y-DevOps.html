<p><strong>DuckDNS and AWS HACKS</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>HACK 1: Create a diagram (Canva). What are the pros and cons of using DuckDNS? Show a diagram of an application running on AWS using a DuckDNS system.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/sushi-burrito/images/copied_from_nb/images/duckdns.png" alt="duckdns.png"></p>
<ol>
<li>HACK 2: Write a reflection. Why do we use DNS? How does DuckDNS work? What makes DuckDNS unique? How is DuckDNS useful for our projects? What are the steps to setup DuckDNS? </li>
</ol>
<p>DNS is an essential component of the internet infrastructure that enables us to access websites and services using human-readable domain names instead of IP addresses. Without DNS, navigating the internet would be a much more complicated process. DuckDNS is a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to assign a custom domain name to a dynamic IP address. DuckDNS is unique in that it is completely free and open-source, making it an accessible option for individuals and small businesses who cannot afford paid DNS services. Additionally, DuckDNS offers a simple and easy-to-use API that allows users to update their DNS records programmatically, making it a flexible option for developers and automation. DuckDNS is useful for projects that require remote access to a network or server using a custom domain name. Setting up DuckDNS involves signing up for an account, choosing a subdomain, downloading a client software or using the API to update DNS records, configuring your router, and testing your setup. Overall, DuckDNS is a useful tool for anyone looking for a free and accessible dynamic DNS solution that allows them to assign custom domain names to dynamic IP addresses.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>HACK 3: (EXTRA CREDIT): Create your own DuckDNS setup video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HACK 4: In 2-3 complete sentences, talk about any outdated Nginx/Docker functionalities that may need to be addressed or any confusions you may have in regards to the deployment process from Trimesters 1 and 2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nginx/Docker has an old command called "docker run" command that should be changed because it's been replaced with "docker container run". Also, watch out for those outdated configurations because they might be using weak SSL protocols and ciphers that could mess with your security. It's a good idea to update them to use modern and secure options.</p>
<ol>
<li>HACK 5: Create a Venn Diagram comparing Nginx with Lighttpd.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/sushi-burrito/images/copied_from_nb/images/nginx.png" alt="nginx.png"></p>
<ol>
<li>HACK 6: Complete the Python quiz and attach your output from the notebook (should be done once you do the quiz.)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>CERTBOT HACKS</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions below and provide a full screenshot of all terminal commands after and including sudo certbot --apache all the way until it asks for the domain you want to secure. At this point you can take a screenshot and cancel the process. If you choose to continue the setup process and get Certbot fully working and show a before and after screenshot of your domain with http amd https connection we will grant extra credit points on hacks, or make up for lost points in other areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>could not get further than this
<img src="/sushi-burrito/images/copied_from_nb/images/cerbot.png" alt="cerbot.png"></p>
<ol>
<li>Research and compare the security features of OpenSSL and LibreSSL, and write about the recent vulnerabilities within it. Write about your research in a fastpages blog post. It can be the same post that has your screenshot for the Certbot Hacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>OpenSSL and LibreSSL are both open-source libraries that provide cryptographic functions for applications. While OpenSSL has been widely used for many years, LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL that was created in response to concerns about the security and development practices of OpenSSL. One notable difference between OpenSSL and LibreSSL is the approach to security. LibreSSL focuses on improving the security of the codebase, while OpenSSL prioritizes backwards compatibility and interoperability. For example, LibreSSL removed support for several outdated protocols and ciphers, while OpenSSL continued to support them. Both OpenSSL and LibreSSL have been affected by several vulnerabilities. One notable vulnerability in OpenSSL was the "Heartbleed" bug, which allowed an attacker to access sensitive information from a server's memory. In response, the OpenSSL project increased its focus on security and created a dedicated team to perform security audits and reviews. On the other hand, LibreSSL has also faced vulnerabilities such as "LibreSSL RNG bug", "LibreSSL malloc() bug" and more. It has since then adopted more rigorous coding standards and has a more focused approach to security, including extensive testing and auditing of the codebase. In conclusion, both OpenSSL and LibreSSL provide important security functions for applications, but there are differences in their approach to security. OpenSSL prioritizes compatibility and interoperability, while LibreSSL places more emphasis on improving security. It is important for developers to stay up-to-date on the latest vulnerabilities and updates for both libraries to ensure the security of their applications.</p>
<p><strong>SCORING GUIDELINES</strong>:</p>
<p>As talked about in class, we'll be looking for effort in the hacks. Though some setups may inevitably not work, we want to see that you took a stab at it and that you understand what the errors you're getting might mean.</p>
<p>FOR 2/4 SECTIONS OF HACKS COMPLETE: <strong>HIGHEST WILL BE A 3.2/4 POSSIBLE --&gt; 0.8/1</strong></p>
<p>FOR 3/4 SECTIONS OF HACKS COMPLETE: <strong>HIGHEST WILL BE A 3.6/4 POSSIBLE --&gt; 0.9/1</strong></p>
<p>FOR 4/4 SECTIONS OF HACKS COMPLETE: <strong>YOU CAN GET UP TO A 4/4 --&gt; 1/1</strong></p>
